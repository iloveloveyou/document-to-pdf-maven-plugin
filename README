maven-document-to-pdf-plugin
============================

Creates PDF files from Office documents.

Requires Libre office to be installed.

Works well on Linux, but not on Windows: --headless still starts a popup which needs to be terminated by a user.

For that I stopped working on this project as it seems to be impossible to get this thing to work crossplatform.

If you just want Linux support, it should be easy to use it into your project:
* Git clone it
* Release it into your local artifact repository
* Use it.

Sample configuration:
<build>
    <plugins>
        <plugin>
          <groupId>com.squins.maven.plugins</groupId>
            <artifactId>document-to-pdf-maven-plugin</artifactId>
            <version>1.0-SNAPSHOT</version>
            <executions>
                <execution>
                    <goals>
                        <goal>export</goal>
                    </goals>
                    <phase>generate-resources</phase>
                </execution>
            </executions>
            <configuration>
                <documentDirectory>${project.basedir}/src/main/documents</documentDirectory>
                <outputDirectory>${project.build.outputDirectory}</outputDirectory>
            </configuration>
        </plugin>
    </plugins>
</build>
